**Authors**: Eric Roberts, Justin Williams

## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is looking to create their own movie content. They need to know what factors are currently driving success at the box office. Our overarching goal is to determine why movies are doing well, and make reccomendations for the Microsoft team.

***
Questions:
* What genre of movies are most profitable?
* What is the optimal time of year to maximize profits?
* Does higher average rating drive profitability?
***

## Data

The data being used for this project came from a multitude of sources:
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* TheMovieDB.org

They contain various datapoints most prominently utilized in our analysis were:
* Domestic, Foreign and Total Gross
* Release date
* Genre
* Average Rating

Profitability was operationalized as total gross to allow us to reach conclusions. These conclusions where which genre, what time of year (seasonality), and average rating generates the most profit. Once data was cleaned and categorized, the resulting analysis 

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

## Conclusions

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

***
Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
